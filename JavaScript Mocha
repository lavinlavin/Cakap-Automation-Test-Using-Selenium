JavaScript Mocha

The exported code for JavaScript Mocha is built to work with Node 10, Mocha 6.1.x, and the latest version of Selenium 4.

You should be able to take the exported JavaScript file and run it after installing these dependencies (e.g., with npm install).

Here's a sample package.json to help you get started.

{
  "dependencies": {
    "mocha": "^6.1.4",
    "selenium-webdriver": "^4.0.0-alpha.3"
  }
}
